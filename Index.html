			<h1>US Startups and Funding</h1>
			In between an idea and a startup, come several stages of funding and
			valuations and after each of these, the equity is divided. The end comes
			either as a success with Initial Public Offering, or as an Acquisition or
			even Bankruptcy.
			<h3>Scroll down to learn everything about these stages</h3>

				<h1>The Beginning</h1>
				<h3>The Idea and the Founders</h3>
				It all begins with the idea. The founder has an idea that he wants to work on. A co-founder could also join at this time.
				<h3>Investment</h3>
				At this stage the founders may ask Family and Friends for investments.
				<h3>Equity Pie</h3>
				The equity is divided between the founders and the family and friends.
				<h3>Entrepreneurs are Back !</h3>
				The rate of new Entrepreneurs measures the percentage of the U.S. adult population that became entrepreneurs, on average, in a given year.
			Notice that after a tremendous decrease post recession, the rate has fortunately taken an upward turn in 2014. <br>(Data taken from the Kauffman Foundation)

			<section class="step" id="second">
				<h1>Seed Stage</h1>
				<h3>Angel Investments</h3>
				This is the first stage of raising outside investments. Angel investors are a group of individuals who invest into
				the company in exchange for equity. These investors focus on helping the business succeed. 
				<h3>Equity Pie</h3>
				The equity is again shared with the new angel investors.
			</section>
			
			<section class="step" id="third">
				<h1>Angel Investments</h1>
				<h3>Total Investments in Billion Dollars</h3>
				The total investment by Angel Investors ranges between 16-30 Billion Dollars with a range of 200,000 USD to 1M USD per company.
				<h3>Total Ventures receiving funds and Active Investors</h3>
				A good point to note as a young entrepreneur is that the percentage of ventures receiving funds from angel investors 
				to the total ventures applying for funding, has been increasing since 2001. A probable reason might be the increase in the 
				number of active investors.

				<h1>Angel Investments by Sectors</h1>
				Data published by Center for Venture Research 
				suggests that the Software industry has consistently attracted a significant fraction of angel investments, followed closely by the Healthcare industry(Quandl.com)
			</section> 
			
			<section class="step" id="fifth">
				<h1>Angel Exits and Returns</h1>
				Depending on the initial success there are three outcomes at this stage:
				<h3>Success in attracting Venture Capitals</h3>
				<h3> Mergers and Acquisitions</h3>
				These represent "A Good Exit". As clear from the graph, in recent years acquisitions of small companies by larger organizations have gained momentum. If unsuccessful in attracting Venture capitals,
				this option is far better than Bankruptcy.
				<h3>Bankruptcy</h3>
				This represents "A Bad Exit". Notice the almost opposite graphs for Acquisitions and Bankruptcies. This indicates that more the number of acquisitions, the fewer the bankruptcies of small companies.

				<h1>Venture Capitals</h1>
				Venture capitals are firms specialized in investing in high potential startup companies.
				VC firms are comprised of people who invest into the VC fund, known as the limited partners, 
				and those who invest the fund's money in startup companies, known as the venture capitalists or general partners.

				<h1>Venture Capital Investment Stages</h1>
				Apart from the Seed stage, the VC stages can be divided into:
				<h3>Early Stage</h3>
				Early stage is the first round in the VC stage also called Series A round. Generally this stage raises between $3M-$5M in exchange for 20% of the company.
				<h3>Expansion Stage</h3>
				Very few and successful companies make this far! At this stage you are expanding by attracting more capital. Notice that the VC investment is highest for this stage.
				<h3>Mezzanine or Later Stage</h3>
				The last stage before public offering.

				<h1>Venture Capital Exits</h1>
				If a company hasn't achieved enough success to sell the stocks in public, then this means failure for Venture Capital Investors</section>

				<h1>Initial Public Offering</h1>
				<h3>Congratulations! You made it !</h3>
